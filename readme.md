Hello, Node: A Web Server
==========================

In this project, I'm making a basic node.js server. Software is open source under MIT License. See file license.md for full details.

Very important: Prior to working with/testing this script on my machine running Ubuntu v12.04, I had to run a few commands to install Node.js and the npm package manager for it. First was...

sudo apt-get install nodejs

Then, one for the package manager...

sudo apt-get install npm

Fuller installation instructions, including setup for OS X and Windows, are available on Joyent Inc.'s Node.js wiki at https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installation








CHANGELOG

12/07/13: Set up several files for project. Ran simple nodeserver1.js server and got 'hello world' response back.

12/8/13: Did minor tweaks, pushed to GitHub from desktop to make sure everything is working OK.

12/9/13: Added a www folder with a simple html file inside for testing purposes. Will use this stuff later to make sure that the http server is serving up Web pages as it should.

UPCOMING

    Set it up as a public Web server
    Add video serving capabilities
    Install on a cloud-based server
