Hello, Node: A Web Server
==========================

In this project, I'm making a basic node.js server. Software is open source under MIT License. See file license.md for full details.

Very important: Prior to working with/testing this script on my machine running Ubuntu v12.04, I had to run a few commands to install Node.js and the npm package manager for it. First was...

sudo apt-get install nodejs

Then, one for the package manager...

sudo apt-get install npm

Fuller installation instructions, including setup for OS X and Windows, are available on Joyent Inc.'s Node.js wiki at https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installation
